Doxyfile-api is used to generate documentation for framework/ and modules/
its goal is to be used on the continuous integration platform.
Documentation goes in doc/api

doxygen.sh builds documentation individually for different directories;
it uses Doxyfile.in and doxygen-packages.txt.
Not sure if anybody uses this, though.

Doxyfile and Doxyfile.git, well, I dunno.
