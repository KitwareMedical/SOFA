  abstract = {{I}n this paper we introduce a new approach for the embedding of lin-
	ear elastic deformable models. {O}ur technique results in signi��?cant
	improvements in the ef��?cient physically based simulation of highly
	detailed objects. {F}irst, our embedding takes into account topologi-
	cal details, that is, disconnected parts that fall into the same
	coarse element are simulated independently. {S}econd, we account
	for the varying material properties by computing stiffness and interpola-
	tion functions for coarse elements which accurately approximate the
	behaviour of the embedded material. {F}inally, we also take into
	account empty space in the coarse embeddings, which provides a better
	simulation of the boundary. {T}he result is a straightforward approach
	to simulating complex deformable models with the ease and speed associated
	with a coarse regular embedding, and with a quality of detail that
	would only be possible at much ��?ner resolu- tion.},
