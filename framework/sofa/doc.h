 *  Simulated bodies in SOFA are split into components storing the current
 *  state (MechanicalState), handling mass properties (Mass), computing
 *  forces (ForceField) and constraints (Constraint), and managing the
 *  integration algorithm (AnimationLoop, OdeSolver).
 *
 *  Depending on the solvers used, two modes of computations are used :
 *  \li <i>vector</i> mode : computations are done directly in the vectors
 *    stored in MechanicalState (used for explicit schemes or iterative
 *    solvers such as conjugate gradient).
 *  \li <i>matrix</i> mode : matrices corresponding to the mechanical system of
 *    equations are constructed, and then inversed to compute the new state.
 *  Not all components support the matrix mode of computation, as it is rather
 *  new and not yet finalized.
