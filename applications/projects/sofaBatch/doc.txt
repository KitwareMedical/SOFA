 sofaBatch permits to automatically save states of several simulations without open the GUI (and so without X-server).
 It is useful to run several simulations during the night on a distant server.
 
A list of scenes .scn are given, and for each a number of time steps to compute and a .simu output namefile.
Resulting  .simu and simulation files will be saved in the 'simulation' directory.
 
Theses tasks must be written as a list in a text file (see the file Sofa/applications/projects/sofaBatch/tasks as an example):
//.scn names    #time steps     output name
scene1.scn       100              mysimu1
scene2.scn       1876             mysimu2
scene3.scn       15               mysimu3
...

Running command: sofaBatch listFileName
(example: Sofa/bin/sofaBatch Sofa/applications/projects/sofaBatch/tasks)

Files mysimu1.simu, mysimu2.simu, mysimu3.simu, ... are created in Sofa/applications/projects/sofaBatch/simulation and they can be loaded with runSofa to visualize results.
