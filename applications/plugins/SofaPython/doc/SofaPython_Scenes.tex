\section{SofaPython scene files}

It is possible, once the plugin is charged in runSofa, to load python script *.py files directly instead of xml *.scn files. This way, you can create scene graphs in a procedural way instead of a descriptive way.

An example of this is provided in the \textcode{examples/PythonScene.py} sample scene of the plugin.
