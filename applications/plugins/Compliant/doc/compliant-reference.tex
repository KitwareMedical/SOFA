\section{Lagrangian Dynamics}
Given an $n$-dimensional state space $Q$, we consider a Lagrangian
$\LL$ defined as usual:
%
\begin{equation}
\LL(q, v) = \half v^TMv - V(q)
\end{equation}
%
where $V(q)$ a the potential energy of the form:
%
\begin{equation}
V(q) = \half \norm{g(q)}_N^2
\end{equation}
%
for a matrix norm $N$ in the suitable deformation space $Im(g)$. To be
fully general, we include a Rayleigh dissipation function $\half
v^TDv$, where $D$ is PSD. The Euler-Lagrange equations of motions are,
in this case:
%
\begin{equation}
 \frac{d}{dt}\ddd{\LL}{v} = \ddd{\LL}{q} - \ddd{D}{v} 
\end{equation}
%
For simplicity, we restrict to the case where $M$ is constant, which
yields:
%
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:dynamics}
  M \dot{v} = -\nabla_q V - D v
\end{equation}
%
\section{Time Stepping}
%
We now discretize time using a fixed time step $h$. We use forward
differences for $\dot{v}$ as follows:
%
\begin{equation}
  h\ \dot{v}_{k+1} \approx v_{k+1} - v_k
\end{equation}
%
Equation \eqref{eq:dynamics} becomes: 
%
\begin{equation}
  M v_{k+1} = M v_k - h \block{\nabla_q V_{k+1} + D v_{k+1}}
\end{equation}
%
Or, calling $p_k = M v_k$ the momentum of the system and $f_k =
-\nabla_q V_k$ the potential forces:
%
\begin{equation}
  \block{M + h\ D} v_{k+1} = p_k + h f_{k+1}
\end{equation}
%
In order to control how implicit our integrator is on forces, we
introduced a blending parameter $\alpha \in [0, 1]$ as follows:
%
\begin{equation}
  \block{M + h \alpha D} v_{k+1} = p_k - h(1 - \alpha) D v_k + h \block{(1 - \alpha) f_k + \alpha f_{k+1}}
\end{equation}
%
We linearize the above using the Hessian of the potential energy:
%
\begin{equation}
\nabla_q V_{k+1} \approx \nabla_q V_k + \nabla_q^2 V_k \block{q_{k+1} - q_k}
\end{equation}
%
so that:
%
\begin{equation}
  (1 - \alpha) f_k + \alpha f_{k+1} = f_k - \alpha \nabla_q^2 V_k \block{q_{k+1} - q_k}
\end{equation}
%
Finally, we use the following position time-stepping scheme:
%
\begin{equation}
  q_{k+1} = q_k + h \block{ (1-\beta) v_k + \beta v_{k+1}}
\end{equation}
%
where $\beta \in [0, 1]$ is again a blending parameter.
%
Letting the stiffness matrix be $K = \nabla_q^2 V_k$ %
\footnote{
%
  This is the opposite of the stiffness matrix as defined in SOFA,
  \emph{i.e.} $\nabla f(q) = -\nabla_q^2 V$. I find it easier to work with
  PSD matrices.} and $d_k = -D v_k$ be the damping forces, we put
everything together as:
%
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:time-stepping}
  \block{M + h\alpha D + h^2 \alpha \beta K} v_{k+1} = 
  p_k + h \block{ f_k + (1 - \alpha) d_k} - \alpha ( 1 - \beta) h^2 K v_k 
\end{equation}
%
(and yes, this is very ugly). Fortunately, everyone would use the much
friendlier, fully implicit scheme $\alpha = \beta = 1$ as follows:
%
\begin{equation}
   \block{M + hD + h^2K} v_{k+1} = p_k + h f_k
\end{equation}
%
\section{Response Matrix, Net Momentum}
%
From now on, we will refer to the \emph{response matrix} defined as
follows:
%
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:response-matrix}
  W = \block{M + h\alpha D + h^2 \alpha \beta K}
\end{equation}
%
We will also refer to the \emph{net momentum} of the system at time
step $k$:
%
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:net-momentum}
  c_k = p_k + h \block{ f_k + (1 - \alpha) d_k} - \alpha ( 1 - \beta) h^2 K v_k
\end{equation}
%
The time-stepping scheme \eqref{eq:time-stepping} thus involves solving
the following linear system:
%
\begin{equation}
  W v_{k+1} = c_k
\end{equation}
%
The numerical solvers for time-stepping will be described in section
\ref{sec:solvers}.
%
\section{Constraints}
\label{sec:constraints}
%
We now introduce holonomic constraints of the form:
%
\begin{equation}
  g(q) = 0
\end{equation}
%
where $g$ again maps kinematic DOFs to a suitable deformation space
$Im(g)$. Such constraints are satisfied by introducing constraint
forces $J^T\lambda$, where $J = \dd g$ is the constraint Jacobian
matrix, and $\lambda$ are the \emph{Lagrange multipliers}:
%
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:constrained-dynamics}
  M \dot{v} &= -\nabla_q V - D v + J^T \lambda\\
  g(q) &= 0
\end{align}
%
Again, we discretize time and $\dot{v}$ as follows:
%
\begin{align}
  M v_{k+1} &= p_k + h \block{f_{k+1} + d_{k+1} + J_{k+1}^T\lambda_{k+1}} \\
  g\block{q_{k+1}} &= 0 
\end{align}
%
And again:
\begin{equation}
g( q_{k+1}) = g_k + h J_k \block{ (1 - \beta) v_k + \beta v_{k+1}}  
\end{equation}
%
At this point we become lazy so we approximate constraints as
\emph{affine} functions, meaning that $J_{k+1} \approx J_k$, otherwise
computing the constraint Hessian $\dd^2 g$ would be too costly, and
would result in a non-linear system to solve anyways (\emph{i.e.}
with terms involving $v_{k+1}^T\dd^2g_k \lambda_{k+1}$). As we will
see later, such approximation is consistent with our treatment of
potential forces as compliant constraints. The time-discrete system is
then:
%
\begin{align}
  M v_{k+1} &= p_k + h \block{f_{k+1} + d_{k+1} + J_k^T\lambda_{k+1}} \\
  J_k v_{k+1} &= -\frac{g_k}{\beta h} - \frac{1 - \beta}{\beta} J_k v_k
\end{align}
% 
At this point, we \emph{could} introduce an implicit blending between
$\lambda_k$ and $\lambda_{k+1}$, but this would result in unneeded
complication as $\lambda_{k+1}$ would need to be computed anyways. The
blended force would then be:
\[ J_k^T\block{ (1-\alpha) \lambda_k + \alpha \lambda_{k+1} } \] which
simply offsets $\lambda_{k+1}$ with respect to $\lambda_k$. We will
thus happily ignore such blending. The final linear system to solve
(for $v_{k+1}$ and $\lambda_{k+1}$) becomes:
%
\begin{align}
\label{eq:constrained-integrator}
  W v_{k+1} - J_k^T \lambda_{k+1} &= c_k  \\
  J_k v_{k+1} &= -b_k
\end{align}
where $b_k = \frac{g_k}{\beta h} + \frac{1 - \beta}{\beta} J_k
v_k$. Before leaving, note the sneaky accounting of $h$ inside
$\lambda_{k+1}$.
%
\section{Compliance}
\label{sec:compliance}
%
We will now establish a connection between elastic forces and
constraint forces through a compliance matrix. Remember that we
defined potential energy as:
%
\begin{equation}
  V(q) = \half \norm{g(q)}_N^2
\end{equation}
%
where $g$ maps kinematic DOFs to an appropriate deformation space
$Im(g)$. This means the potential forces are:
%
\begin{equation}
  f = - \nabla_q V = J^T N g(q)
\end{equation}
%
Now, the Hessian or stiffness matrix is :
%
\begin{equation}
  K = \nabla^2_q V = \dd J^T N g(q) + J^T N J
\end{equation}
%
As in section \ref{sec:constraints}, we are too lazy for computing
second derivatives so we approximate deformation mappings as affine
maps, meaning that $\dd J \approx 0$. We are left with the following
response matrix \eqref{eq:response-matrix}:
%
\begin{equation}
  W = \block{M + h\alpha D + h^2 \alpha \beta J_k^T N J_k}
\end{equation}
%
The net momentum \eqref{eq:net-momentum} becomes:
%
\begin{equation}
  c_k = p_k + h (1 - \alpha) d_k - h J_k^TN \block{ g_k + h \alpha ( 1 - \beta) J_k v_k}
\end{equation}
%
If we write the potential force as $J_k^T \lambda_{k+1}$, we have: 
\begin{equation}
  \lambda_{k+1} = -N\block{h^2 \alpha \beta J_k v_{k+1} + h g_k + h^2 \alpha (1 - \beta) J_k v_k}
\end{equation}
It turns out that this system can be rewritten as a \emph{larger} system:
%
\begin{equation}
  \mat{M + h \alpha D & -J_k \\
    J_k & \frac{\inv{N}}{h^2 \alpha \beta} } \mat{v_{k+1} \\ \lambda_{k+1}} = \mat{p_k + h (1 - \alpha) d_k \\ -\frac{g_k}{h \alpha \beta} - \frac{( 1 - \beta)}{\beta} J_k v_k }
\end{equation}
%
(pffew !) One can notice that this system is \emph{almost} exactly the
one we obtained with kinematic constraints in
\eqref{eq:constrained-integrator}, with $\alpha = 1$, with the
exception of the $\inv{N}$ term in the $(2, 2)$ block. We call matrix
$C = \inv{N}$ the \emph{compliance} matrix. We see that kinematic
constraints simply correspond to a zero compliance matrix, \emph{i.e.}
infinite stiffness, as one would intuitively expect. It can be checked
that taking $\alpha$ into account for constraint forces produces the
same system with $C = 0$. (TODO) We now recall the main results for
the unified elastic/constraint treatment:
%
\subsection*{Linear System}
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:time-stepping-kkt}
  \mat{ W & -J \\
    -J & -\frac{C}{h^2 \alpha \beta} } \mat{v \\ \lambda} = \mat{c_k \\ b_k}
\end{equation}
%
\subsection*{Response Matrix}
%
\begin{equation}
  W = M + h\alpha D
\end{equation}
%
\subsection*{Net Momentum}
%
\begin{equation}
c_k = p_k + h (1 - \alpha) d_k  
\end{equation}
%
\subsection*{Constraint Value}
%
\begin{equation}
  b_k = \frac{g_k}{h \alpha \beta} + \frac{( 1 - \beta)}{\beta} J_k v_k
\end{equation}
%
TODO pourquoi c'est cool: transition seamless entre contraintes et
elasticite, traitement unifié contraintes/elasticité, conditionnement
pour les sytemes très raides. par contre ca fait des systèmes plus gros.
%
\section{KKT Systems, Compliance and Relaxation}
%
At this point, it is probably a good idea to introduce a few notions
on saddle-point (or KKT) systems. Such systems are (for now, linear)
systems of the form:
%
\begin{equation}
 \label{eq:kkt-system}
 \mat{Q & -A^T \\-A & 0} \mat{x\\\lambda} = \mat{c\\b}
\end{equation}
%
KKT systems typically arise from the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (hence the
name) optimality conditions of constrained optimization problems. For
instance, the KKT system \eqref{eq:kkt-system} corresponds to the
following equality-constrained Quadratic Program (QP):
%
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:constrained-optimization}
  \underset{Ax + b = 0}{\textrm{argmin}} \quad \half x^T Q x - c^T x
\end{equation}
%
The KKT system summarizes the optimality conditions for the following
unconstrained function (also called the \emph{Lagrangian}, this time in the
context of optimization):
%
\begin{equation}
  \LL(x, \lambda) \quad = \quad \half x^T Q x - c^T x \quad - \quad \block{A x + b}^T \lambda
\end{equation}
%
and whose critical points (in fact, saddle-points) solve the
constrained problem \eqref{eq:constrained-optimization}. As one can
see, the constrained integrator \eqref{eq:constrained-integrator} is
an example of such KKT systems:
\begin{equation}
  \mat{W & -J\\-J & 0} \mat{v \\ \lambda} = \mat{c \\ b}
\end{equation}
%
where we dropped subscripts for the sake of readability. As symmetric
\emph{indefinite} systems, they tend to be more difficult to solve
than positive definite ones: CG and Cholesky $LDL^T$ factorizations
may breakdown on such systems. However, when the $(1, 1)$ block (here,
matrix $Q$) is invertible, one can use \emph{pivoting} to obtain the
following smaller system:
%
\begin{align}
  x &= \inv{Q}\block{c - A^T \lambda} \\
  -A x &= A\inv{Q}A^T \lambda - A\inv{Q} c = b \\
  \label{eq:schur-complement}
  A\inv{Q}A^T\lambda &= b - A \inv{Q} c
\end{align}
%
This smaller system \eqref{eq:schur-complement} is known as the
\emph{Schur} complement of the KKT system. It is always SPD as long as
$A^T$ is full column-rank, but requires to invert $Q$ which might be
costly in practice. The Schur complement system also corresponds to an
(unconstrained) optimization problem:
%
\begin{equation}
  \argmin{\lambda}\quad \half \lambda^T S \lambda - s^T \lambda
\end{equation}
%
where $S = A \inv {Q} A^T$ is the Schur complement, and $s = b +
A\inv{Q}c$. The minimized quantity has a physical interpretation:
typically, holonomic constraints minimize the total kinetic energy. If
we now consider systems with compliance, such as:
%
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:compliant-kkt-system}
  \mat{Q & -A^T \\-A & -D} \mat{x\\\lambda} = \mat{c\\b}
\end{equation}
%
we see that they correspond to the following Lagrangian:
%
\begin{equation}
  \LL(x, \lambda) \quad = \quad \half x^T Q x - c^T x \quad - 
  \quad \block{A x + b}^T \lambda \quad - \quad \half \lambda^T D \lambda
\end{equation}
%
One can check that the Schur complement becomes $S + D$, and
corresponds to:
%
\begin{equation}
  \argmin{\lambda}\quad \half \lambda^T S \lambda - s^T \lambda \quad + 
  \quad \half \lambda^T D \lambda
\end{equation}
%
We see that $D$ acts as a form of numerical damping on the resolution
of constraints, by biasing the solution of the constrained system
towards zero. It is a form of \emph{constraint
  relaxation}. Physically, elastic forces minimize a mix between the
kinetic energy of the system and the $D$-norm of the forces
$\lambda$. Under their most general form, KKT systems include
unilateral and complementarity constraints. We will develop these in
more details in section \ref{sec:unilateral-constraints}.
%
\section{Geometric Stiffness}
%
For both constraint and elastic forces, we happily neglected
second-order derivatives of the deformation mapping $g$. In the case
of elastic forces, this resulted in a nice stiffness matrix of the
form:
%
\begin{equation}
  \nabla_q^2 V(q) \approx J^T N J = K
\end{equation}
%
which enabled us to treat elastic forces as a compliant kinematic
constraints. But what about the second order terms $\tilde{K}=(\dd
J)^T N g(q)$ ? First of all, when the configuration space is a vector
space $Q$ and $g$ is $\mathcal{C}^2$-continuous, the Schwarz' theorem
ensures that $\nabla_q^2 V$ is symmetric, hence so is $\tilde{K}$. We
call $\tilde{K}$ the \emph{geometric stiffness}, as it is induced by
the variation of the deformation mapping $g$. We do not know whether
in the general case, it is possible to factor \emph{both} $K$ and
$\tilde{K}$ as:
%
\begin{equation}
  \nabla_q^2 V(q) = K + \tilde{K} \overset{?}{=} J^T\block{N + \tilde{N}}J
\end{equation}
%
even though some specific examples exist (\emph{e.g.} mass spring
systems). Of course, it is always possible to apply a Cholesky
factorization directly on $\nabla_q^2 V(q)$ as:
%
\begin{equation}
  \nabla_q^2 V(q) = LDL^T
\end{equation}
%
and get back on our feet, but this would be highly inefficient in
practice. Therefore, unless an ad-hoc derivation provides the needed
factorization, we are left with only one alternative: treat the
geometric stiffness as a regular stiffness instead of compliance.
%
\section{Unilateral Constraints}
\label{sec:unilateral-constraints}
%
We now consider \emph{unilateral constraints} (inequality) instead of
bilateral ones:
%
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:unilateral-constraint}
  g(q) \geq 0
\end{equation}
%
Examples of such constraints include non-penetration constraints, or
angular limits for an articulated rigid body. Just like in the
bilateral case, the constraints are enforced by the addition of
constraint forces $J^T \lambda$, satisfying velocity constraints of
the form:
%
\begin{equation}
  J v_{k+1} \geq -b_k
\end{equation}
%
obtained by differentiation of \eqref{eq:unilateral-constraint},
according to the time-stepping scheme. Furthermore, reaction forces
must satisfy additional requirements known as the Signorini
conditions:
%
\begin{itemize}
\item constraint forces must be repulsive: $\lambda_{k+1} \geq 0$
\item constraint forces don't act when the constraint is inactive, and
  conversely:
  \[ J_k v_{k+1} > -b_k \Rightarrow \lambda_{k+1} = 0, \quad \lambda_{k+1} > 0 \Rightarrow J_k v_{k+1} = -b_k \]
\end{itemize}
%
Intuitively, a non-penetration contact force is not allowed to push
bodies further apart when they are already separating. The
requirements on constraint forces are summarized by the following
\emph{complementarity} constraint:
%
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:complementarity-constraint}
  0 \leq J_k v_{k+1} + b_k \ \bot \ \lambda_{k+1} \geq 0 
\end{equation}
%
The time-stepping scheme with constraint forces is, as before:
%
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:time-stepping-unilateral}
  W v_{k+1} -J_k^T \lambda_{k+1} = c_k
\end{equation}
%
It turns out that the complementarity constraints
\eqref{eq:complementarity-constraint} together with time-stepping
equation \eqref{eq:time-stepping-unilateral} form the KKT conditions
of the following \emph{inequality-constrained} Quadratic Program:
%
\begin{equation}
  v_{k+1} = \argmin{J_kv + b_k\  \geq\  0} \quad \half v^TWv - c_k^T v
\end{equation}
%
Therefore, time-stepping in the presence of unilateral constraints can
be readily solved by a general QP solver. As in the bilateral case,
when $W$ is easily invertible, it is possible to compute the Schur
complement in order to obtain an equivalent, but smaller problem:
%
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:lcp}
  0 \leq J\inv{W}J^T \lambda_{k+1} + b_k - A\inv{W} c_k\ \bot \ \lambda_{k+1} \geq 0 
\end{equation}
%
(TODO: check formula) Such problem is known as a \emph{Linear
  Complementarity Problem} (LCP) and can be solved by various
algorithms, some of which will be presented in section
\ref{sec:solvers}.
