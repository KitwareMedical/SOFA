<h1 style="text-align: center;">Creating a composite object using a
SubsetMultiMapping</h1>

<div style="text-align: center;">François Faure, 2013<br>

<br>

This page explains how to create a composite object as illustrated in
the following image, in an efficient way. The object is composed of a
deformable beam connected to rigid parts at the two ends. This requires
to attach points to the rigid objects using a RigidMapping, and to
connect these points to the FEM.&nbsp; <br>

Using AttachConstraint is not an option because it works only for
independent DOFs, and the points mapped to the rigid object are not
independent.<br>

The classic way would be to connect the deformable object to the rigid
objects using springs. However, this would require stiff springs which
harm the numerical conditioning of the system, without attaching the
points rigidly. <br>

Replacing the spring with hard constraints using Lagrange multipliers
requires a constraint solver which consumes computation time.<br>

The solution we propose avoids these drawbacks.<br>

Our approach is to distribute the FE vertices in two separate groups:
the mapped vertices at the ends, and the independent vertices in the
central part. This requires separate State components and graph nodes.
Unfortunately, the FEM force fields are internal, therefore they can
not be used to connect vertices of different objects. More generally,
FE models are typically defined as a whole and it is not easy to split
them.<br>

To overcome this limitation, we define the whole FE model as a common
child of the independent and the mapped particles, using a
MultiMapping, as illustrated in the next figure. The complete FEM,
including elements and masses, is defined at the bottom, while the
independent DOFs are the independent particles and the frames near the
top. The SubsetMultiMapping simply copies values from and to the two
subsets of particles.<br>

This way, there is no need to constrain FE vertices on the rigid
objects. They are perfectly attached using a mapping, without
introducing stiffness or hard constraints. The only additional cost is
due to the copies of state vectors through the SubsetMultiMapping.<br>

The implementation in SOFA requires to address some issues:<br>

<ol>

  <li>Multimappings (mappings with several parents) can not generally
match tree structures. A directed acyclic graph (DAG) is required,
therefore the sofa::simulation::Simulation must be an instance of
DAGSimulation. This requires to uncheck the following line in you
sofa-local.prf file:<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DEFINES += SOFA_HAVE_DAG</code></li>
  <li>DAG structures can not currently be parsed from xml files. Such a
simulation must be created in C++, as given in this directory, or in
Python (no example available yet).<br>
  </li>
  <li>The initialization of the scene is made bottom-up, because the
FEM is given, and the mapped and independent particles are created
based on it. This is opposite to the standard, top-down mapping
initialization of SOFA. Therefore, the mapped and independent particles
must be carefully set before the standard initialization, so that their
top-down propagation to the FE model does not change the position of
the vertices.<br>
  </li>
</ol>

An example is given in <a href="compositeObject.cpp">compositeObject.cpp</a>.
To compile it, you need to
activate the tutorials by uncommenting the following line in your
sofa-local.prf: <code> DEFINES += SOFA_HAVE_TUTORIALS </code> <br>
