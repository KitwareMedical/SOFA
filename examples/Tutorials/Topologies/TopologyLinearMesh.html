	The aim of this tutorial is to show the importance of topological components. Indeed, in this tutorial, two linear pendulums are represented, implying:
	<ul>
		<li>A mechanicalObject with geometry point positions.</li>
		<li>A mass for gravity and fixed points.</li>
		<li>A mesh spring forcefield to create springs between points</li>
		<li>An ODE scheme and a linear solver to solve the system at each time step.</li>
	</ul>
        <br>
	<div id="orangeText">Key points</div>
	<br>
	The only difference between the models is the MeshTopology component. In the first case, edges are defined. Thus, meshSpringForceField will know a list of edges where it will create springs. In the other case, no springs are created.
	<br>
	<br>
	<div id="orangeText">Results</div>
	<br>
	Thus, when simulated, the first model will act as a pendulum, whereas in the other case, points will just fall down, as they are not attached together.
