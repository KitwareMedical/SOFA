	This tutorial shows a very useful mapping available in SOFA. As its name suggests, this mapping enables you to get a tetrahedral topology from a hexadral one.
	Therefore, this mapping divides each hexahedron into 6 tetrahedra. This can be very useful to get tetrahedra if you are working with a RegularGrid geometry.<br> <br>

	By using the Hexa2TetraTopologicalMapping, you will collect all the data concerning the tetrahedra in the following components:
	<ul>
          <li> TetrahedronSetTopologyContainer,</li>
          <li> TetrahedronSetTopologyModifier,</li>
          <li> TetrahedronSetTopologyAlgorithms,</li>
          <li> TetrahedronSetGeometryAlgorithms.</li>
        </ul>

	<p>It must be stressed that the default division of each hexahedron is always made in the same way, so that it can lead to mesh orientation.
	To avoid this bias effect, a swapping method is proposed just by activating a flag "swapping" in order to perform the better division. </p>

	<p>And do not forget that topological changes are not handled in this mapping.</p>
