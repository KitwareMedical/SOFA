		<br><div id="orangeText">Description</div>
        
		<p>This final step is a second pipeline of topological mappings from an hexahedral mesh to a triangular one, going through Quads.</p>

		<div id="orangeText">Key points</div>
        <p>
        <ul>
		  <li>Dynamic topological components to store the quad mesh. </li>
		  <li><b>Hexa2QuadTopologicalMapping</b> component is used to map Quads on the border of the hexahedral mesh to this container.</li>
		  <li>Dynamic topological components to store the triangular mesh. </li>
		  <li><b>Quad2TriangleTopologicalMapping</b> component is used to map Quads to Triangles.</li>
		  <li>Springs are added to the edges of the surface of the mesh using <b>TriangularBendingSprings</b>.</li>
		  <li>Finally, <b>OglModel</b> is used to visualize the surface mesh.</li>
		</ul>
        </p>
        
        <div id="tutorialAction"><p>Press the <strong>Edit in Modeler</strong> button at the top of this window.</p></div>
        
        <p>Again, a pre-built scene graph opens in the Modeler. You can also look at the details of the scene in the right panel of this window.</p>
        
        <p>Here we see five nodes, each a child of the previous node. This is a good visual representation of the flow of the collision pipeline.</p>
        
        <p>Starting at the <strong>root</strong> node, we have all the basic components needed for the scene, including the <strong>DefaultPipeline</strong>.</p>
        <p>Next we come to the <strong>Hexahedral Mesh</strong>, which includes the Ogl solver to determine the forces that the model will experience.</p>
        
        <p>Once the solver determines the movement of the hexahedrons, the <strong>Quad Mesh</strong> maps that movement to a quad representation of only the surface of the model.</p>
        
        <p>In turn, the <strong>Triangles Mesh</strong> maps the movement of the quad representation to a triangular representation. Here we also add springs and constraints to the surface.</p>
        
        <p>Finally, all the information that has been passed down the pipeline is used by <strong>Visu</strong> to create a visualization of the surface of the model.</p>

		<p>This last step shows another example of topological mappings with a mechanical behavior similar to step <a href="4_TopoMapping.scn">Change mesh behaviour</a>.</p>
