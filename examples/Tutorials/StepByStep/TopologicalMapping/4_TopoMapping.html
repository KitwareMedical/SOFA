		<br><div id="orangeText">Description</div>
		<p>This step shows that it is possible to define mechanical behavior directly on a child topology. This can be useful, as often the surface mesh is only a small part of the entire topology.</p>

		<div id="orangeText">Key points</div>
        <p>
        <ul>
		  <li>Springs are added to the edges on surface of the mesh using <b>TriangularBendingSprings</b>.</li>
		  <li><b>TriangleModel</b> components can be added to interact with the model (using <strong>Shift</strong> and the mouse).</li>
		</ul>
        </p>
        
        <div id="tutorialAction"><p>Add a <strong>TriangularBendingSprings</strong> component to the <strong>Triangles Mesh</strong> node. Change the <strong>uniform stiffness for all the springs</strong> property to 10.</p></div>
        
      
		<div id="orangeText">Results</div>
        
        <div id="tutorialAction"><p>Run in SOFA and Animate. Deform the cylinder by holding down the <strong>Shift</strong> key and dragging the triangles with the mouse.</p></div>

		<p>In this step, edges on the surface of the mesh have springs, so the cylinder doesn't bend as much as in the previous steps.
		The advantage is that elements in the rest of the cylinder are not taken into account, resulting in faster computation.</p>
