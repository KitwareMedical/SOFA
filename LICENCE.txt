  Authors: See Authors.txt


SOFA is an Open Source framework primarily targeted at real-time simulation, 
with an emphasis on medical simulation. It is mainly intended for the 
research community to help foster newer algorithms, but can also be used as 
an efficient prototyping tool. SOFA's advanced software architecture allows:
(1) the creation of complex and evolving simulations by combining new algorithms with 
    existing algorithms; 
(2) the modification of key parameters of the simulation  such as deformable
    behavior, surface representation, solvers, constraints, collision algorithm, etc. by 
    simply editing an XML file; 
(3) the synthesis of complex models from simpler ones using a scene-graph description; 
(4) the efficient simulation of the dynamics of interacting objects using abstract 
    equation solvers; and 
(5) the comparison of various algorithms available in SOFA. 


LICENSES: 

The SOFA distribution is composed of three parts:
 - SOFA FRAMEWORK: this is essential the core of SOFA
 - SOFA MODULES: represent the functionalities available in SOFA
 - SOFA APPLICATIONS: they are built using the SOFA framework and modules.
